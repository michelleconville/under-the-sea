## Deployment
### Project creation
This project was created by using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) in github. Gitpod was used to write the code and push the code to repository created in github.

The git commands I used to push the code from gitpod to github were

`git add .` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

`git commit -m “commit message”` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

`git push` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Deployment to github pages
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
*   In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
*   From the menu on left select *pages*
*   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
*   Click the *save* button
*   A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully.

### Clone the repository
The steps to clone a repository are as follows:
1.	Navigate to the GitHub repository you would like to clone
2.	Click on the code drop down button
3.	Click on the HTTPS tab
4.	Copy the repository link to the clipboard
5.	Open Git Bash
6.	Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
7.	Type git clone and then paste the URL from the clipboard 

    `git clone https://github.com/michelleconville/under-the-sea.git`
8.	Press Enter to create your local clone.

The repository will now be cloned on your local machine for use.
